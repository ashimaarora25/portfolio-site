      <h3> Daily Automated ETL Pipeline with Apache Airflow & PostgreSQL </h3>
      <p> Designed and deployed a daily automated ETL pipeline that leverages Apache Airflow to orchestrate the ingestion and processing of Amazon book metadata. Python scripts handle data transformation before loading it into a PostgreSQL database. This setup fully automates the data ingestion, transformation, and storage process, enabling efficient management and querying of structured Amazon books data.</p>

      <h3> Real-Time ETL Pipeline with Apache Kafka & AWS </h3>
      <p> Designed and deployed an end-to-end ETL pipeline to simulate near real-time streaming data generation using Python. Implemented Apache Kafka for data ingestion and processing, with Kafka Producers and Consumers publishing to and consuming from a Kafka Broker hosted on Amazon EC2. Processed data is stored in Amazon S3, where an AWS Glue Crawler catalogs the data. Using Amazon Athena, the cataloged data is queried and loaded into a SQL database for downstream analytics. This setup enables continuous, low-latency data ingestion, transformation, and analytics, supporting near real-time insights on stock market data.  </p>
